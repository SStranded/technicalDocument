              <p>
                Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory in common, but all other
                faculties
                were most unequally shared between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive
                apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde;
                but
                Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in
                which
                he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’s interest; Hyde had more than a son’s
                indifference. To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly
                indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests
                and
                aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear
                unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer
                smartingly
                in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my
                circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same
                inducements
                and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with
                so
                vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to
                keep to
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes;
                and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and
                secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I made this choice perhaps with some
                unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward
                Hyde,
                which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two
                months, I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations
                of an
                approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of
                conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of
                Hyde
                struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and
                swallowed
                the transforming draught.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five
                hundred
                times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,
                long
                as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and
                insensate
                readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was
                punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even when I took the
                draught,
                of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred
                in my
                soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare,
                at
                least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a
                provocation;
                and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything.
                But I
                had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues
                to
                walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly,
                was
                to fall.

                  In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and
                  Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally
                  eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which
                  Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the
                  former continued the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I have not
                  already
                  heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything
                  before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”

                “Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. “What a letter is this,
                to
                be written
                at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever
                he
                might
                afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have
                felt
                it!”

              <p>
                “I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill
                immediately,
                and the whole house in such confusion!”

                “Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story

                the end of
                the day?”

                  fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death--there stood Henry
                  Jekyll!

                "And where is it?" I asked, smiling.

              <p>
                "In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity.
                "I
                have just
                been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we

                We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road
                stood our
                horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed
                down the
                London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines
                of
                villas on
                either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.

              <p>
                Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold,
                scanty
                and
                embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At
                friendly
                meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something
                indeed which
                never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner
                face, but more
                often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to
                mortify a taste
                for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But
                he
                had an
                approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits
                involved in
                their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s
                heresy,”
                he used to
                say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently
                his
                fortune to
                be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to
                such as
                these, so
                long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.
              </p>
              <p>
                No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his
                friendship
                seemed to
                be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his
                friendly
                circle
                ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his
                own
                blood or
                those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no
                aptness in the
                object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the
                well-known
                man about
                town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could
                find in
                common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing,
                looked
                singularly
                dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the
                greatest store
                by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of
                pleasure, but even
                resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.
              </p>
              <p>
                It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London.
                The street
                was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were
                all
                doing
                well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains
                in
                coquetry;
                so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling
                saleswomen. Even
                on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street
                shone
                out in
                contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,
                well-polished
                brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the
                passenger.

              <p>
                A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining. We all
                followed
                his
                movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of
                phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming
                alive with
                rats.
              </p>
              <p>
                For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an
                emergency.
                Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and
                which
                I had seen
                myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his
                little
                silver
                whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered from behind Dr. Seward's house by
                the
                yelping of
                dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously
                we
                had all
                moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which
                had
                been
                taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had
                vastly
                increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving
                dark
                bodies
                and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs
                dashed
                on, but at
                the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl
                in
                most
                lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.

                Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor. The instant his
                feet
                touched the
                ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast
                that before
                he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner,
                had
                but small
                prey ere the whole mass had vanished.

                  "I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time," said Dorian, pouring himself out some
                  wine and frowning slightly.
